            This is a practice website and soon to be blog about travel,
            seamsnship, navigation, and straight up pillaging. Not in a bad way,
            but as a metaphor for going out and getting what you want. Its
            website and blog where I'll keep adding to it and see what it looks
            like as I continue my journey to become a Software Engineer. Its a
            blog about taking action, and as motivation to not be passive and be
            more proactive. Im guilty, I will be honest,I as a young man in my
            20's I think back and feel like I could of done more, but although I
            wasnt terrible: started traveling at the age of twenty, and now,
            thirteen years later, I'm in quarentine in Medellin, Colombia. A lot
            has happened in the last few years.-- I will write about this in my
            blog, as I think back to all the adventures Ive been on the last few
            years. These are adventures of seafaring, and going to places Id
            never though Id visit, and doing things that many travelers can only
            dream of.

            I will use this website and blog to write down my ideas, and to
            document as I plan for the future. The more I write, the more I can
            stay focused, motivated, and energized as I build my skills. My main
            focus is to build websites, read Nietzsche, and write. I have not
            built the blog page yet on my website, so I will use this page for
            now.--

            So far I've been in Medellin, Colombia for almost a month, I was
            supposed to go home back to San Diego for a few days and make my way
            back to Florida, where I plan on settling down for a bit, save some
            money, and travel South America for a few months. I also need to get
            in to an online web development bootcamp. I will need ot test into
            the program, which requires me to be able to build simple websites
            and write simple JavaScript functions, loops, and conditionals.

            Today is March 29th 2020, Im living during the Chinese Virus, Corona
            Virus, COVID-19, whatever--Im thinking about staying here until
            June. This gives me time to work on my programming full-time,
            specially now that we're in quarentine I can put in a lot of work.
            My goal is to get really good at HTML and CSS, where I can
            comfortably build websites. As I mentioned earlier, I also need to
            learn JS basics. The point is to self-teach am much as possible, I
            have all the resources available.
          </p>
          <div class="empty"></div>
          <p class="bg-grey">
            My short-term goal, in the next few months is: first, learn html,
            css, and js basics. Ill give myself till the end of the year to
            learn, and save as much as possible. Next year, Janurary 2020, I
            will need to start the online bootcamp, and have money saved up so
            that I can take six months off and smash out all the school
            work--and be done around June 2021. Now we're supposed to be getting
            a $1200 check, direct deposit in the next three weeks; also supposed
            to get a $500 refund from Norwegian Airlines, This is great news,
            I'll be able to stay longer and work on web development.

            I can definitely get used to this. I must admit that I have been
            very productive these last two weeks. I have gotten a lot of work
            done and built this website in just a few days. Some times we think
            that were not getting any better, but if you're persistent, soon
            youll find out that youve been making progress and get a boost of
            energy.

            I think that I should stay in Medellin when I finish my school
            work... Its close to Florida, if for any reason I need to be there,
            its just a quick flight, and also its faily cheap. Or I could also
            check out south of Brazil and Eastern Europe once the 'rona clears
            out. Considering how things work out; I can do mini-trips of two
            weeks or one, we'll see.
