            Poast: 1 March 29th 2020 I'm finaly starting to build websites and
            its getting exciting. In just a few days Im starting to get the hang
            of it. I do believe that, If I end up staying till Juine I can
            really get some work done, and get really good. I do need some more
            help and practice, but doing great for now. Im definitely better
            than I was last year, this time of year. It doesnt really seem like
            I've been doing this for a long time because I have genuinely
            enjoyed the practice. Its difficult to to stay on top of it but,
            because I travel so much for work but once you do it snowballs
            quickly, so stick with it! This makes me think that when I go back
            to Florida or California (wherever the job comes-up),It will have to
            be program where I dont travel and dont do much either. There is a
            possibility also that, with the extra money coming in (hopefully),
            that I'll be able ot stay even longer but, this all depends on how
            much I spend, and when the borders open up. I could possibly get an
            extension, or if the borders open up, maybe go somewhere else.
            <strong>Perseverance</strong> Here is the key word. In everything
            that I'm involved with: weight lifting, programing, making money,
            building new skills, travel, and getting what I want. So I have to
            think of what is most Important right now. Right now I need to 100%
            focused on Web Development, the faster I learn, the faster I can
            start making money online. I need to build as many websites as
            possible. With this in mind, I will set a goal of 20 websites by
            June; this gives me two months. The point here to start making money
            online, and eventually work as a professional full stack web
            developer.
